    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Taco</strong> is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small
      hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version tweaked the original recipe by adding salad and beef filling
      to fit my taste buds.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
      <li>1 head iceberg lettuce - rinsed, dried, and shredded</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>4 ounces crushed tortilla chips</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup French dressing, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Place</strong> ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook and stir over
        medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain and discard grease. Add taco
        seasoning mix and prepare according to package directions. Set aside to
        cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine</strong> cooled beef mixture, lettuce, onion, bell pepper, cheese,
        tomatoes, and tortilla chips in a large serving bowl. Add enough
        dressing to coat; mix well and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
